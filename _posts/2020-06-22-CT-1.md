```python
board = [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,3],[0,2,5,0,1],[4,2,4,4,2],[3,5,1,3,1]]

moves = [1,5,3,5,1,2,1,4]

def solution(board, moves):
    answer = 0
    basket = []
    for j in moves:
        for i in range(len(board)):
            if board[i][j-1] != 0:
                basket.append(board[i][j-1])
                board[i][j-1] = 0
                if len(basket)>=2 and basket[-1] == basket[-2]:
                    basket.pop()
                    basket.pop()
                    answer += 2
                break
    return answer
